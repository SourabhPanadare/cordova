					<p>Pachisi or ludo originated in India by the 6th century. The earliest evidence of this game in India is the depiction of boards on the caves of Ajanta.</p>
					<p>This game was played by the Mughal emperors of India; and kings of India. It is said that the Mysore Ruler Customized the game to 6 Players so he could play with his 5 queens together.</p> 
					<p>Variations of the game made it to England during the late 19thcentury. One which appeared around 1896 under the name of Ludo.</p> 
					<p>The players alternate turns in a clockwise direction.To enter a token into play from its staging area to its starting square, a player must roll a 6. </p>
					<p>If the player has no tokens yet in play and does not roll a 6, the turn passes to the next player. Once a player has one or more tokens in play, he selects a token and moves it forward along the track the number of squares indicated by the die roll. </p>
					
					<p>Players must always move a token according to the die value rolled, and if no move is possible, pass their turn to the next player.</p>
					<p>When a player rolls a 6 he may choose to advance a token already in play, or alternatively, he may enter another staged token to its starting square.</p>					
					<p>A player may not end his move on a square he already occupies. If the advance of a token ends on a square occupied by an opponent's token, the opponent token is returned to its owner's yard. The returned token may only be re-entered into play when the owner again rolls a 6.</p>
